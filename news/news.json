Investor kripto populer dengan nama pengguna di platform X, CoinMamba mengomentari keserakahan dari tim dan investor dalam kasus ini.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So EigenLayer team and investors are getting 55% but stakers are getting only 5% and even that will not be transferable at the beginning.<br><br>The amount of greed crypto developers and VCs are exhibiting just keeps suprising me every time..</p>&mdash; CoinMamba (@coinmamba) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/coinmamba/status/1785004852944257255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">April 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Jadi tim EigenLayer dan investor mendapatkan 55%, tetapi staker hanya mendapatkan 5%, dan bahkan itu tidak akan dapat ditransfer pada awalnya.

Token ini harus di-<em>stake </em>untuk memungkinkan pengguna melakukan tugas tertentu. Dalam konsep token kerja ini, ada mekanisme yang disebut <em>slashing</em>, di mana pelanggar aturan akan dikenai penalti dengan menyita token yang di-<em>stake</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Whitepaper </em>EigenLayer juga memperkenalkan model <em>staking </em>baru yang bertujuan untuk meningkatkan fleksibilitas dan keamanan. Model ini berfokus pada universalitas, memungkinkan token digunakan untuk berbagai tugas digital, serta verifikasi intersubjektif, yang memungkinkan kesepakatan antar pengamat mengenai pelaksanaan tugas. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dengan pendekatan ini, EigenLayer berharap dapat meningkatkan keamanan kripto-ekonomi dan mendorong Ethereum menuju ekosistem yang lebih terbuka dan dapat diverifikasi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baca juga: <a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/eigenlayer-dapat-kucuran-dana-rp15-triliun-dari-a16z\" data-type=\"berita\" data-id=\"88931\"><strong>EigenLayer Dapat Kucuran Dana Rp1,5 Triliun dari a16z</strong></a></p>","link":"https://coinvestasi.com/berita/eigenlayer-umumkan-airdrop-rilis-whitepaper-terbaru","img_url":"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/30_04_2024_airdrop-eigenlayer.jpg","pub_date":"2024-04-30T08:45:06.000","coin":["ETH"]},{"source":"Coinvestasi","title":"Pengguna Indodax Diduga Jadi Korban Grup Hacker Lazarus","description":"<p>Detektif blockchain, ZachXBT telah menerbitkan laporan investigasi tentang Grup Lazarus, grup peretas Korea Utara yang diduga bertanggung jawab atas beberapa pencurian kripto terbesar dalam sejarah industri ini.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Pada sebuah <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1784935501935390930\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1784935501935390930\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">postingan</a> di platform X, ZachXBT membagikan <em><a href=\"https://zachxbt.mirror.xyz/B0-UJtxN41cJhpPtKv0v2LZ8u-0PwZ4ecMPEdX4l8vE\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://zachxbt.mirror.xyz/B0-UJtxN41cJhpPtKv0v2LZ8u-0PwZ4ecMPEdX4l8vE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link</a> </em>menuju artikel yang membahas investigasinya dalam melacak 25 serangan yang mempengaruhi individu dan perusahaan di bidang kripto.

Yusuf Musa, Brenda, dan Andreas Tobing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Per 20 April 2024 Bitcoin telah resmi melakukan halving keempat, peristiwa di mana imbalan Bitcoin kepada penambang berkurang setengahnya dari 6,25 menjadi 3,125. Berbeda dari tahun 2020 saat halving ketiga terjadi, di halving keempat ini, Bitcoin telah diadopsi oleh institusi besar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Menurut Brenda Andrina, “Harga Bitcoin saat ini sangat dipengaruhi oleh institusi besar. Sejak Bitcoin mencetak harga tertinggi di atas US$70.000 dan koreksi hingga saat ini, kita melihat <em>outflow </em>BTC yang besar dari ETF Grayscale”, katanya.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brenda optimis ke depannya, akan lebih banyak produk-produk baru dari institusi besar, yang akan mendukung adopsi Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dalam diskusi ini narasumber juga menyoroti perbedaan siklus harga Bitcoin di tahun 2021 dan 2024. Pada siklus-siklus sebelumnya, yakni sebelum tahun 2021, pasar kripto belum menjadi perhatian besar bagi perusahaan-perusahaan besar. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tokoh seperti Michael Saylor, CEO dari MicroStrategy yang saat ini memegang sekitar 1% dari pasokan beredar Bitcoin, bahkan baru mulai mengakuisisi BTC di tahun 2022. ETF Bitcoin spot, dengan 10 perusahaan penerbit di AS termasuk BlackRock, baru mulai debut di awal tahun 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pergerakan harga khususnya Bitcoin, juga menunjukkan perbedaan. Di siklus sebelumnya, harga Bitcoin belum pernah menembus harga tertinggi baru sebelum Bitcoin halving. Namun kali ini, harga BTC justru mencetak <em>all time high</em> (ATH) atau harga tertinggi sepanjang masa di level US$73.000 sebelum halving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Biasanya, harga Bitcoin akan mengalami koreksi 40-50% sebelum halving, tapi kali ini bahkan harga Bitcoin sudah menembus ATH sebelumnya,&#8221; ungkap Andreas Tobing mengenai pergerakan harga Bitcoin di siklus kali ini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andreas juga mengungkapkan bahwa, “Potensi kenaikan harga Bitcoin terhitung dari saat halving ke harga puncak <em>bull market </em>akan berkurang dari sebelumnya. Hal ini disebabkan karena kapitalisasi pasar Bitcoin yang semakin besar dari siklus ke siklus, sehingga perlu dana yang semakin besar untuk menggerakkan harga.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baca juga: <a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/7-altcoin-ini-lampaui-performa-harga-bitcoin-di-q1-2024\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"berita\" data-id=\"89937\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>7 Altcoin Ini Lampaui Performa Harga Bitcoin  di Q1 2024</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"narasi-potensial-ekosistem-bitcoin-layer-2-dan-rwa\">Narasi Potensial: Ekosistem Bitcoin, Layer-2, dan RWA</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Narasumber di acara CIO 2024 juga menyebutkan beberapa narasi kripto potensial yang menyertai siklus kali ini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Mungkin sesuatu yang sebelumnya belum ada, seperti layer-2 Bitcoin, Bitcoin DeFi, atau protokol yang dibangun di atas jaringan Bitcoin,” ungkap Andreas Tobing, menyatakan optimismenya terhadap perkembangan ekosistem Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perlu diketahui, <em>developer </em>saat ini telah berusaha bereksperimen terhadap jaringan Bitcoin untuk menjadikan Bitcoin bukan hanya sekadar menjadi media transfer saja.

Institusi besar seperti BlackRock, tahun ini akan mengeluarkan aset ter-tokenisasi setara Dolar AS, yakni BUILD, menambah keyakinan dari narasi ini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Di siklus ini, kita banyak melihat <em>scaling solution </em>untuk Ethereum.

Langkah ini diharapkan dapat meningkatkan pendeteksian, pencegahan, dan penuntasan aktivitas kripto-kriminal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dilaporkan media lokal, <a href=\"https://www.segye.com/newsView/20240428508879?OutUrl=naver\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Segye Ilbo</a>, (28/4/2024), unit baru ini, terdiri dari para ahli dari berbagai bidang, termasuk penuntutan, keuangan, dan intelijen, unit ini mewakili pendekatan multidisiplin untuk mengatasi kejahatan keuangan yang canggih ini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baca juga: <a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/otoritas-korea-selatan-investigasi-worldcoin\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"berita\" data-id=\"89251\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Otoritas Korea Selatan Investigasi Worldcoin</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"respons-terhadap-peningkatan-kejahatan-kripto\">Respons Terhadap Peningkatan Kejahatan Kripto</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Langkah ini merupakan respons langsung terhadap meningkatnya kompleksitas kejahatan aset virtual yang sering membutuhkan pengetahuan khusus dan koordinasi lintas yurisdiksi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Negara ini mengalami peningkatan signifikan dalam aktivitas kriminal terkait kripto. Menurut laporan bulan Februari oleh Unit Intelijen Keuangan Korea Selatan, perusahaan kripto lokal melaporkan 16,076 transaksi mencurigakan pada tahun 2023, menandai peningkatan 49% dari tahun 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Selain itu, Korea Selatan akan menerapkan peraturan kripto komprehensif pertamanya yang bertujuan untuk melindungi investor pada 19 Juli. Peraturan baru ini memberlakukan hukuman pidana yang lebih ketat bagi mereka yang memanipulasi pasar kripto, termasuk hukuman seumur hidup dalam kasus-kasus tertentu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tindakan proaktif Korea Selatan juga mencerminkan tren global karena negara-negara di seluruh dunia berjuang untuk meningkatkan regulasi dan pemantauan dalam pasar kripto yang berkembang pesat. Selain itu, unit investigasi Korea Selatan diharapkan akan berkolaborasi dengan lembaga-lembaga internasional untuk mengatasi sifat lintas batas dari kejahatan kripto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baca juga: <a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/won-korea-selatan-jadi-fiat-paling-banyak-digunakan-trading-kripto\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"berita\" data-id=\"90060\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Won Korea Selatan Jadi Fiat Paling Banyak Digunakan Trading Kripto</strong></a></p>","link":"https://coinvestasi.com/berita/korea-selatan-bentuk-unit-resmi-investigasi-kripto","img_url":"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/29_04_2024_korea_investigasi.jpg","pub_date":"2024-04-30T02:35:07.000","coin":["WLD"]},{"source":"U.Today","title":"Binance Founder CZ Could Be Sentenced to Years in Prison Tomorrow","description":"The Binance found could spend years behind bars","content":"The Binance found could spend years behind bars","link":"https://u.today/binance-founder-cz-could-be-sentenced-to-years-in-prison-tomorrow","img_url":"https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/64/26572754.jpeg","pub_date":"2024-04-30T02:31:51.000","coin":[]},{"source":"CoinDesk","title":"As Wasabi Wallet and Phoenix Leave the U.S., Whats Next for Non-Custodial Crypto?","description":"Following DOJ action against Samourai Wallet and a possible Metamask investigation, Wasabi Wallet and Phoenix are closing their U.S. offerings.
