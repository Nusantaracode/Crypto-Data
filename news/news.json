Bagaimana konflik ini bisa terjadi? Simak kronologinya di sini.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kronologi-konflik-certik-dan-kraken\">Kronologi Konflik CertiK dan Kraken </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Konflik ini bermula pada 9 Juni 2024. Kraken menerima peringatan program<em> bug bounty </em>dari seorang yang diduga peneliti keamanan.&nbsp;Peringatan tersebut menyorot<em>i bug</em> di sistem Kraken yang memungkinkan pengguna meningkatkan saldo akun mereka. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ketika pertukaran kripto memperbaiki <em>bug</em> tersebut, mereka menemukan tiga akun yang memanfaatkan kelemahan tersebut dan mencuri US$3 juta atau setara Rp49 miliar dari akun Kraken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kraken awalnya tidak mengungkap siapa peneliti keamanan yang mencuri uang tersebut, tetapi  pada 19 Juni <a href=\"https://x.com/CertiK/status/1803450205389402215\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://x.com/CertiK/status/1803450205389402215\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Certik</a> secara mandiri memberikan pengakuan bahwa mereka adalah dalang dibalik penemuan masalah dan eksploitasi tersebut. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certik yang menemukan <em>bug</em> berhak mendapatkan hadiah yang ditawarkan Kraken. Namun, tampaknya tidak ditemukan kesepakatan segera dan justru terjadi perdebatan antara keduanya, karena CertiK tidak langsung mengembalikan dana yang mereka ambil. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Sebaliknya, mereka meminta panggilan dengan tim pengembangan bisnis mereka (yaitu perwakilan penjualan mereka) dan belum setuju untuk mengembalikan dana apa pun sampai kami memberikan perkiraan jumlah $ yang mungkin disebabkan oleh bug ini jika mereka tidak mengungkapkannya. Ini bukan peretasan <em>white hat</em>, ini pemerasan,” kata Nicholas Percoco, kepala petugas keamanan Kraken. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kraken diketahui meminta CertiK mengembalikan 155.818 MATIC, 907.400 USDT, 475,5 ETH dan 1.089.8 XMR. Namun, CertiK hanya mengembalikan 734 ETH, 29.001 USDT, 1.021 MATIC. CertiK mengklaim jumlah tersebut sesuai dengan data mereka. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Di sisi lain, CertiK menyoroti perilaku Kraken yang memberikan ancaman kepada karyawannya yang menemukan kerentanan tersebut dan Karken yang tidak memberikan mereka alamat <em>wallet</em> untuk mengirim dana tersebut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Setelah konversi awal yang berhasil dalam mengidentifikasi dan memperbaiki kerentanan, tim operasi keamanan Kraken telah MENGANCAM setiap karyawan CertiK untuk membayar kembali sejumlah kripto yang TIDAK SESUAI dalam waktu yang TIDAK WAJAR bahkan TANPA memberikan alamat pembayaran,” kata CertiK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Memperjelas sisi cerita mereka, CertiK merilis garis waktu peristiwa, yang mencakup keseluruhan wacana, dimulai dengan mengidentifikasi eksploitasi pada tanggal 5 Juni.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"698\" height=\"370\" src=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-67.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91491\" srcset=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-67.png 698w, https://wp.coinvestasi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-67-300x159.png 300w, https://wp.coinvestasi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-67-150x80.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Gambar: Kronologi <em>bug </em>yang ditemukan Certik di Kraken.

Kraken menerima peringatan program<em> bug bounty </em>dari seorang yang diduga peneliti keamanan.&nbsp;Peringatan tersebut menyorot<em>i bug</em> di sistem Kraken yang memungkinkan pengguna meningkatkan saldo akun mereka. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ketika pertukaran kripto memperbaiki <em>bug</em> tersebut, mereka menemukan tiga akun yang memanfaatkan kelemahan tersebut dan mencuri US$3 juta atau setara Rp49 miliar dari akun Kraken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kraken awalnya tidak mengungkap siapa peneliti keamanan yang mencuri uang tersebut, tetapi  pada 19 Juni <a href=\"https://x.com/CertiK/status/1803450205389402215\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://x.com/CertiK/status/1803450205389402215\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Certik</a> secara mandiri memberikan pengakuan bahwa mereka adalah dalang dibalik penemuan masalah dan eksploitasi tersebut. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certik yang menemukan <em>bug</em> berhak mendapatkan hadiah yang ditawarkan Kraken. Namun, tampaknya tidak ditemukan kesepakatan segera dan justru terjadi perdebatan antara keduanya, karena CertiK tidak langsung mengembalikan dana yang mereka ambil. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Sebaliknya, mereka meminta panggilan dengan tim pengembangan bisnis mereka (yaitu perwakilan penjualan mereka) dan belum setuju untuk mengembalikan dana apa pun sampai kami memberikan perkiraan jumlah $ yang mungkin disebabkan oleh bug ini jika mereka tidak mengungkapkannya. Ini bukan peretasan <em>white hat</em>, ini pemerasan,” kata Nicholas Percoco, kepala petugas keamanan Kraken. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kraken diketahui meminta CertiK mengembalikan 155.818 MATIC, 907.400 USDT, 475,5 ETH dan 1.089.8 XMR. Namun, CertiK hanya mengembalikan 734 ETH, 29.001 USDT, 1.021 MATIC.

Meskipun adopsi secara luas belum terjadi, institusi keuangan yang sudah menguasai teknologi blockchain akan memiliki keunggulan strategis,” kata para analis dari McKinsey &amp; Co.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Salah satu hambatan utama adalah kompleksitas dalam inovasi awal. Penerbitan token mungkin relatif mudah dan dapat direproduksi dengan cepat, namun untuk mencapai skala yang besar diperlukan adanya efek jaringan.  Efek ini terjadi ketika pengguna mulai merasakan manfaat utama dari tokenisasi, seperti penghematan biaya, peningkatan likuiditas, atau tingkat kepatuhan yang lebih baik.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Selain itu, masalah likuiditas yang terbatas dalam teknologi tokenisasi serta keharusan untuk menawarkan manfaat yang lebih besar dibandingkan sistem keuangan tradisional juga menjadi tantangan tersendiri.</p>\n\n\n<iframe src='https://icn-dev.github.io/coinvestasi-button-shortcode/banner.html?banner_copy=Diskon%2015%25%20Tiket%20Coinfest%20Asia&button_url=https%3A%2F%2Fticket.coinfest.asia%2Fcheckout%2F%3Fadd-to-cart%3D9590951106%26coupon%3DCA24COINVESTASI&button_label=Beli%20Sekarang' style='width: 100%; height: 200px; border: none;'></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>Saat ini, beberapa institusi keuangan besar di AS telah mulai meluncurkan produk tokenisasi dan terus berinovasi di bidang ini.
