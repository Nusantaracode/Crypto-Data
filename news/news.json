Yusuf Musa, Brenda, dan Andreas Tobing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Per 20 April 2024 Bitcoin telah resmi melakukan halving keempat, peristiwa di mana imbalan Bitcoin kepada penambang berkurang setengahnya dari 6,25 menjadi 3,125. Berbeda dari tahun 2020 saat halving ketiga terjadi, di halving keempat ini, Bitcoin telah diadopsi oleh institusi besar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Menurut Brenda Andrina, “Harga Bitcoin saat ini sangat dipengaruhi oleh institusi besar. Sejak Bitcoin mencetak harga tertinggi di atas US$70.000 dan koreksi hingga saat ini, kita melihat <em>outflow </em>BTC yang besar dari ETF Grayscale”, katanya.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brenda optimis ke depannya, akan lebih banyak produk-produk baru dari institusi besar, yang akan mendukung adopsi Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dalam diskusi ini narasumber juga menyoroti perbedaan siklus harga Bitcoin di tahun 2021 dan 2024. Pada siklus-siklus sebelumnya, yakni sebelum tahun 2021, pasar kripto belum menjadi perhatian besar bagi perusahaan-perusahaan besar. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tokoh seperti Michael Saylor, CEO dari MicroStrategy yang saat ini memegang sekitar 1% dari pasokan beredar Bitcoin, bahkan baru mulai mengakuisisi BTC di tahun 2022. ETF Bitcoin spot, dengan 10 perusahaan penerbit di AS termasuk BlackRock, baru mulai debut di awal tahun 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pergerakan harga khususnya Bitcoin, juga menunjukkan perbedaan. Di siklus sebelumnya, harga Bitcoin belum pernah menembus harga tertinggi baru sebelum Bitcoin halving. Namun kali ini, harga BTC justru mencetak <em>all time high</em> (ATH) atau harga tertinggi sepanjang masa di level US$73.000 sebelum halving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Biasanya, harga Bitcoin akan mengalami koreksi 40-50% sebelum halving, tapi kali ini bahkan harga Bitcoin sudah menembus ATH sebelumnya,&#8221; ungkap Andreas Tobing mengenai pergerakan harga Bitcoin di siklus kali ini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andreas juga mengungkapkan bahwa, “Potensi kenaikan harga Bitcoin terhitung dari saat halving ke harga puncak <em>bull market </em>akan berkurang dari sebelumnya. Hal ini disebabkan karena kapitalisasi pasar Bitcoin yang semakin besar dari siklus ke siklus, sehingga perlu dana yang semakin besar untuk menggerakkan harga.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baca juga: <a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/7-altcoin-ini-lampaui-performa-harga-bitcoin-di-q1-2024\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"berita\" data-id=\"89937\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>7 Altcoin Ini Lampaui Performa Harga Bitcoin  di Q1 2024</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"narasi-potensial-ekosistem-bitcoin-layer-2-dan-rwa\">Narasi Potensial: Ekosistem Bitcoin, Layer-2, dan RWA</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Narasumber di acara CIO 2024 juga menyebutkan beberapa narasi kripto potensial yang menyertai siklus kali ini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Mungkin sesuatu yang sebelumnya belum ada, seperti layer-2 Bitcoin, Bitcoin DeFi, atau protokol yang dibangun di atas jaringan Bitcoin,” ungkap Andreas Tobing, menyatakan optimismenya terhadap perkembangan ekosistem Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perlu diketahui, <em>developer </em>saat ini telah berusaha bereksperimen terhadap jaringan Bitcoin untuk menjadikan Bitcoin bukan hanya sekadar menjadi media transfer saja.

Institusi besar seperti BlackRock, tahun ini akan mengeluarkan aset ter-tokenisasi setara Dolar AS, yakni BUILD, menambah keyakinan dari narasi ini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Di siklus ini, kita banyak melihat <em>scaling solution </em>untuk Ethereum. Orang-orang cenderung malas menggunakan Ethereum karena mahal,” ungkap Brenda mengenai narasi layer-2.
