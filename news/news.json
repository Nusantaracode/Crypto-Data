Selama periode tersebut, Consensys diduga memfasilitasi lebih dari 36 juta transaksi kripto, termasuk setidaknya 5 juta transaksi sekuritas kripto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sejak Januari 2023, Consensys juga dikatakan telah menawarkan dan menjual sekuritas tak terdaftar melalui program <em>staking </em>kripto mereka, khususnya layanan MetaMask Staking. Regulator sekuritas itu juga menuduh bahwa Consensys bertindak sebagai broker tidak terdaftar dalam menawarkan program <em>staking </em>pihak ketiga seperti Lido dan Rocket Pool kepada pelanggan MetaMask.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Dengan diduga mengumpulkan ratusan juta dolar dalam bentuk biaya sebagai broker tidak terdaftar dan terlibat dalam penawaran dan penjualan sekuritas yang tidak terdaftar, Consensys secara langsung terlibat dalam pasar sekuritas AS tanpa memberikan perlindungan yang dijamin oleh undang-undang sekuritas federal kepada para investor,” kata Direktur Divisi Penegakan SEC, Gurbir S. Grewal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SEC meminta pengadilan untuk menerapkan berbagai sanksi terhadap Consensys, termasuk perintah tetap, denda sipil, dan tindakan adil lainnya yang dianggap perlu atas pelanggaran tersebut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baca juga: <strong><a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/laporan-consensys-sarankan-indonesia-terapkan-rupiah-digital\" data-type=\"berita\" data-id=\"54713\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Laporan Consensys Sarankan Indonesia Terapkan Rupiah Digital</a></strong></p>\n\n\n<iframe src='https://icn-dev.github.io/coinvestasi-button-shortcode/banner.html?banner_copy=Diskon%2015%25%20Tiket%20Coinfest%20Asia&button_url=https%3A%2F%2Fticket.coinfest.asia%2Fcheckout%2F%3Fadd-to-cart%3D9590951106%26coupon%3DCA24COINVESTASI&button_label=Beli%20Sekarang' style='width: 100%; height: 200px; border: none;'></iframe>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"perang-hukum-consensys-dan-sec\">Perang Hukum Consensys dan SEC</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Di bawah kepemimpinan Gary Gensler, SEC telah memperingatkan sejak 2022 bahwa kripto dan platform yang menawarkan layanan <em>staking </em>mungkin saja memenuhi kriteria <em>Howey Test</em>. Uji ini digunakan untuk menentukan apakah suatu transaksi merupakan kontrak investasi dan dapat dianggap sebagai sekuritas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pada April 2024, Consensys mengajukan gugatan terhadap SEC yang dianggap berusaha mengatur Ethereum (ETH) yang berada di luar lingkup wewenangnya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baca juga: <strong><a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/berusaha-atur-ethereum-eth-consensys-tuntut-sec\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"berita\" data-id=\"90205\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Berusaha Atur  Ethereum Sebagai Sekuritas, SEC Digugat Consensys</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Menurut Consensys, apabila SEC mengambil mengatur ETH sebagai sekuritas maka akan menimbulkan bencana bagi jaringan Ethereum, dan bagi Consensys. Pihaknya juga berargumen bahwa MetaMask tidak berfungsi sebagai broker sekuritas di bawah undang-undang federal AS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“MetaMask hanyalah sebuah antarmuka — seperti browser web — yang memungkinkan pemegang aset digital berinteraksi secara lancar dengan jaringan Ethereum, termasuk semua jaringan Ethereum lainnya,” tulis Consensys pada saat itu.<br>Gugatan terhadap Consensys menambah daftar panjang perusahaan kripto yang menjadi target SEC untuk tindakan hukumnya. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sebelumnya, <em>exchange </em>kripto seperti Binance, Kraken, dan Coinbase, juga menjadi sasaran SEC karena dianggap telah menawarkan beberapa mata uang kripto yang  termasuk ke dalam sekuritas yang tidak terdaftar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baca juga: <strong><a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/coinbase-vs-sec-berlanjut-bahas-definisi-token-sekuritas\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"berita\" data-id=\"88157\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Coinbase Vs SEC Berlanjut, Bahas Definisi Token Sekuritas</a></strong></p>","link":"https://coinvestasi.com/berita/consensys-digugat-sec-terkait-layanan-metamask","img_url":"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/03_07_2024_consenys-sued-by-sec.jpg","pub_date":"2024-07-03T08:40:09.000","coin":["ETH"]},{"source":"CryptoGlobe","title":"Top Crypto Analyst Who Nailed Bitcoins Bear Market Bottom Predicts 400% Surge for Solana-Based Memecoin","description":"A top cryptocurrency strategist who has gained a large following on social media after accurately calling bitcoins 2018 bear market bottom above $3,000 has recently suggested that meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogwifhat ($WIF) could see a major price surge to the $11 mark.

Penurunan ini dipengaruhi oleh sejumlah sentimen yang ada di pasar, beberapa di antaranya adalah sebagai berikut. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"komentar-jerome-powell\">Komentar Jerome Powell</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sikap hati-hati The Fed terkait suku bunga menjadi salah satu tekanan utama. Pada 2 Juli 2024, dalam Konferensi Kebijakan Moneter di Portugal, Ketua The Fed, Jerome Powell, mengatakan bahwa AS kembali ke jalur disinflasi dan yakin bahwa inflasi bergerak turun secara berkelanjutan menuju 2%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Powell tidak akan berkomentar mengenai kapan penurunan suku bunga AS akan dimulai dan mengakui masih butuh lebih banyak data untuk memverifikasi bahwa angka inflasi yang lebih lemah baru-baru ini memberikan gambaran yang akurat tentang ekonomi AS untuk mengambil kebijakan selanjutnya. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Kami hanya ingin memahami bahwa tingkat yang kami lihat adalah gambaran sebenarnya tentang apa yang sebenarnya terjadi dengan inflasi,&#8221; katanya dilansir dari <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-powell-says-more-evidence-falling-inflation-needed-before-rate-cuts-2024-07-02/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-powell-says-more-evidence-falling-inflation-needed-before-rate-cuts-2024-07-02/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Reuters</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sikap The Fed yang masih berhati-hati ini membuat pasar berisiko seperti kripto menjadi ragu-ragu, karena kemungkinan penurunan suku bunga di pertemuan FOMC berikutnya menjadi tidak pasti. Hal ini membuat investor dan individu yang berinvestasi tampaknya menarik dana mereka lebih awal dalam waktu singkat.</p>\n\n\n<iframe src='https://icn-dev.github.io/coinvestasi-button-shortcode/banner.html?banner_copy=Diskon%2015%25%20Tiket%20Coinfest%20Asia&button_url=https%3A%2F%2Fticket.coinfest.asia%2Fcheckout%2F%3Fadd-to-cart%3D9590951106%26coupon%3DCA24COINVESTASI&button_label=Beli%20Sekarang' style='width: 100%; height: 200px; border: none;'></iframe>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"distribusi-btc-mt-gox\">Distribusi BTC Mt.

Pada 2 Juli 2024, dalam Konferensi Kebijakan Moneter di Portugal, Ketua The Fed, Jerome Powell, mengatakan bahwa AS kembali ke jalur disinflasi dan yakin bahwa inflasi bergerak turun secara berkelanjutan menuju 2%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Powell tidak akan berkomentar mengenai kapan penurunan suku bunga AS akan dimulai dan mengakui masih butuh lebih banyak data untuk memverifikasi bahwa angka inflasi yang lebih lemah baru-baru ini memberikan gambaran yang akurat tentang ekonomi AS untuk mengambil kebijakan selanjutnya. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Kami hanya ingin memahami bahwa tingkat yang kami lihat adalah gambaran sebenarnya tentang apa yang sebenarnya terjadi dengan inflasi,&#8221; katanya dilansir dari <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-powell-says-more-evidence-falling-inflation-needed-before-rate-cuts-2024-07-02/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-powell-says-more-evidence-falling-inflation-needed-before-rate-cuts-2024-07-02/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Reuters</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sikap The Fed yang masih berhati-hati ini membuat pasar berisiko seperti kripto menjadi ragu-ragu, karena kemungkinan penurunan suku bunga di pertemuan FOMC berikutnya menjadi tidak pasti.
