Mengapa? Karena game P2E mencoba menarik para pemain ke dalam dunia kripto, yang dianggap bukan tempat untuk mendapatkan kepercayaan atau adopsi massal.\n\nSebagai gantinya, fokusnya kini telah bergeser dengan memberikan para penggemar kripto apa yang mereka inginkan, yakni mendapatkan kripto dengan cepat dan mudah. Sementara model P2E tradisional sering kali memerlukan gameplay yang kompleks dan investasi waktu yang signifikan, permainan \"Tap-to-Earn\" menawarkan pendekatan yang lebih mudah diakses dan menarik. \n\nDengan memanfaatkan platform media sosial yang mudah diakses seperti Telegram, maka akan terbuka akses menuju adopsi massal, baik secara sengaja maupun tidak.\n\n**Ditulis oleh [Alena Shmalko](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/07/08/play-to-earn-is-dead-why-tap-to-earn-marks-a-big-shift/), Ecosystem Lead di TON Foundation.**\n\nSelama tiga bulan terakhir, 210 juta orang telah bersimulasi menjadi CEO dari _exchange_ kripto di Hamster Kombat, sebuah permainan viral jenis tap di Telegram. Tap-to-Earn lainnya yang sukses memiliki jumlah pengguna yang relatif lebih rendah namun tetap besar minatnya untuk game Web3 termasuk TapSwap yang memiliki 50 juta pengguna total, dan Yescoin melampaui 26 juta pemain aktif dalam satu bulan saja. \n\nStatistik ini mirip dengan permainan Web2 tradisional, namun permainan ini mewakili pusat adopsi massal di jantung ekosistem Web3 di Telegram.\n\n## Aplikasi Mini Menggerakkan Adopsi\n\nAplikasi Mini Telegram adalah salah satu narasi atau bahkan mesin penggerak dari siklus adopsi kali ini, dan tren Tap-to-Earn tampaknya menjadi bahan bakar utamanya. \n\nSemuanya dimulai dengan Notcoin, yang berhasil menarik lebih dari 40 juta pemain sejak peluncurannya pada awal tahun 2024. Sebanyak 11,5 juta di antaranya menjadi pengguna Web3 dengan mengklaim token Notcoin ($NOT) setelah terdaftar di Binance, OKX, dan _exchange top-tier_ lainnya.\n\nStrategi mereka sangat jenius dan sejak saat itu diadopsi oleh aplikasi viral lainnya seperti PixelTap. Strategi tersebut mencakup gameplay sepenuhnya _off-chain_ untuk menghindari kesulitan bagi pengguna awal, raih sebanyak mungkin pemain melalui insentif dan _referral_, lalu umumkan airdrop token yang akan datang.\n\nStrategi lainnya juga terbilang cukup berhasil. Misalnya, Yescoin dan Catizen memperkenalkan mekanik _on-chain_ sejak awal. Waktu akan menentukan bagaimana pendekatan yang dipilih oleh masing-masing tim mempengaruhi konversi dan retensi pengguna, terutama setelah Hamster Kombat, TapSwap, dan PixelTap akan meluncurkan token mereka. Catizen dan Notcoin memiliki tingkat konversi dari pengguna _off-chain_ ke on-chain masing-masing sebesar 7% dan 6,2%, jauh lebih tinggi dari rata-rata Telegram yang hanya berkisar 0,6%.\n\n## Faktor Kesuksesan\n\nApa rahasia dari game viral di Telegram? Sederhananya, gameplay dan perkembangan permainan yang menghibur adalah alasan utama mengapa Tap-to-Earn mengalami pertumbuhan luar biasa dalam waktu singkat.\n\nJanji airdrop komunitas adalah titik sukses lainnya untuk jenis game ini. Berbeda dengan protokol DeFi atau Ethereum L2, aplikasi _clicker_ tidak memerlukan tindakan _on-chain_ yang rumit, dan Notcoin memberikan bukti ilustratif tentang hal itu. Sekitar 90% dari pasokan token diberikan kepada komunitas dengan rata-rata hadiah per _wallet_ mencapai USD200. Catizen juga berjanji untuk mendistribusikan 42% dari $CATI yang akan datang, sementara aplikasi lainnya belum mengungkapkan _tokenomics_ mereka.\n\nBahan penting lainnya dari kesuksesan Tap-to-Earn adalah memanfaatkan lapisan sosial dan mendorong pemain untuk mengundang teman dan bersaing dalam skuad untuk mendapatkan hadiah yang lebih tinggi. Semua aplikasi viral ini memilih blockchain TON yang dapat dijelaskan oleh kemudahan _onboarding_ ke Telegram, bersama dengan basis pengguna globalnya yang mencapai 950 juta.\n\nTidak ada salahnya mendapatkan dukungan dari pemain besar di Web3 yang juga mendukung strategi ini. Studio game Web3 terkemuka dan perusahaan modal ventura Animoca Brands membuat taruhan besar pada Telegram dan kini memilih TON sebagai mitra Web3 mereka, termasuk platform game milik Animoca yakni GAMEE yang memiliki lebih dari 80 juta pengguna, yang baru-baru ini mengumumkan peluncuran token mereka di TON mengikuti praktik yang telah teruji dari proyek-proyek TON lainnya.\n\n## Bukan Sekedar Hiburan\nMenariknya, pendekatan Tap-to-Earn juga diadopsi oleh aplikasi lain selain game. _Exchange_ kripto hibrida Blum memulai dengan mekanisme _clicker_ sederhana dan Quest-to-Earn yang berhasil menarik 30 juta pengguna sebelum meluncurkan fungsi produk inti mereka. Ini menunjukkan bahwa Tap-to-Earn pada dasarnya dilihat sebagai alat _onboarding_ yang efektif dan sumber pendapatan yang menguntungkan.\n\nBanyak yang secara wajar mempertanyakan keberlanjutan tren Tap-to-Earn serta kualitas dari lalu lintas yang ditarik. Bagaimana tim-tim ini akan mengelola untuk mendidik dan mempertahankan pengguna serta menawarkan nilai jangka panjang tetap menjadi pertanyaan terbuka. Beberapa berencana untuk bertindak sebagai penerbit game atau platform _quest_, sementara yang lain berjanji untuk menyediakan produk _e-commerce_ atau perdagangan. \n\nNotcoin telah berhasil mempertahankan metrik _on-chain_ mereka pada tingkat yang layak, mempertahankan status sebagai meme coin terbesar berdasarkan jumlah pemegang token _on-chain_ yakni hampir 2,5 juta.\n\nPada tahun 2024, pengguna merasa bahwa aplikasi dan game yang pantas mendapatkan perhatian mereka adalah yang memberi imbalan kepada semua orang atas usaha, waktu, dan perhatian mereka. \nTelegram dan TON tetap terbuka untuk semua jenis dan genre game, tetapi adopsi massal tampaknya akan didorong oleh beberapa yang sederhana. Satu kebenaran yang semakin terlihat jelas adalah raksasa industri berikutnya hanya tinggal beberapa ‘ketukan’ lagi.\n\n**Baca juga: [Game Telegram PinEye Catat 500 Ribu Pengguna Aktif dalam Sepekan](https://www.coindesk.id/berita/sponsor/game-telegram-pin-eye-catat-500-ribu-pengguna-aktif-dalam-sepekan)**","content":"Game Play-to-Earn (P2E) dengan cepat muncul di dunia digital, namun mereka mengalami kegagalan.

Catizen dan Notcoin memiliki tingkat konversi dari pengguna _off-chain_ ke on-chain masing-masing sebesar 7% dan 6,2%, jauh lebih tinggi dari rata-rata Telegram yang hanya berkisar 0,6%.\n\n## Faktor Kesuksesan\n\nApa rahasia dari game viral di Telegram? Sederhananya, gameplay dan perkembangan permainan yang menghibur adalah alasan utama mengapa Tap-to-Earn mengalami pertumbuhan luar biasa dalam waktu singkat.\n\nJanji airdrop komunitas adalah titik sukses lainnya untuk jenis game ini. Berbeda dengan protokol DeFi atau Ethereum L2, aplikasi _clicker_ tidak memerlukan tindakan _on-chain_ yang rumit, dan Notcoin memberikan bukti ilustratif tentang hal itu. Sekitar 90% dari pasokan token diberikan kepada komunitas dengan rata-rata hadiah per _wallet_ mencapai USD200. Catizen juga berjanji untuk mendistribusikan 42% dari $CATI yang akan datang, sementara aplikasi lainnya belum mengungkapkan _tokenomics_ mereka.\n\nBahan penting lainnya dari kesuksesan Tap-to-Earn adalah memanfaatkan lapisan sosial dan mendorong pemain untuk mengundang teman dan bersaing dalam skuad untuk mendapatkan hadiah yang lebih tinggi. Semua aplikasi viral ini memilih blockchain TON yang dapat dijelaskan oleh kemudahan _onboarding_ ke Telegram, bersama dengan basis pengguna globalnya yang mencapai 950 juta.\n\nTidak ada salahnya mendapatkan dukungan dari pemain besar di Web3 yang juga mendukung strategi ini. Studio game Web3 terkemuka dan perusahaan modal ventura Animoca Brands membuat taruhan besar pada Telegram dan kini memilih TON sebagai mitra Web3 mereka, termasuk platform game milik Animoca yakni GAMEE yang memiliki lebih dari 80 juta pengguna, yang baru-baru ini mengumumkan peluncuran token mereka di TON mengikuti praktik yang telah teruji dari proyek-proyek TON lainnya.\n\n## Bukan Sekedar Hiburan\nMenariknya, pendekatan Tap-to-Earn juga diadopsi oleh aplikasi lain selain game. _Exchange_ kripto hibrida Blum memulai dengan mekanisme _clicker_ sederhana dan Quest-to-Earn yang berhasil menarik 30 juta pengguna sebelum meluncurkan fungsi produk inti mereka. Ini menunjukkan bahwa Tap-to-Earn pada dasarnya dilihat sebagai alat _onboarding_ yang efektif dan sumber pendapatan yang menguntungkan.\n\nBanyak yang secara wajar mempertanyakan keberlanjutan tren Tap-to-Earn serta kualitas dari lalu lintas yang ditarik. Bagaimana tim-tim ini akan mengelola untuk mendidik dan mempertahankan pengguna serta menawarkan nilai jangka panjang tetap menjadi pertanyaan terbuka. Beberapa berencana untuk bertindak sebagai penerbit game atau platform _quest_, sementara yang lain berjanji untuk menyediakan produk _e-commerce_ atau perdagangan. \n\nNotcoin telah berhasil mempertahankan metrik _on-chain_ mereka pada tingkat yang layak, mempertahankan status sebagai meme coin terbesar berdasarkan jumlah pemegang token _on-chain_ yakni hampir 2,5 juta.\n\nPada tahun 2024, pengguna merasa bahwa aplikasi dan game yang pantas mendapatkan perhatian mereka adalah yang memberi imbalan kepada semua orang atas usaha, waktu, dan perhatian mereka. \nTelegram dan TON tetap terbuka untuk semua jenis dan genre game, tetapi adopsi massal tampaknya akan didorong oleh beberapa yang sederhana. Satu kebenaran yang semakin terlihat jelas adalah raksasa industri berikutnya hanya tinggal beberapa ‘ketukan’ lagi.\n\n**Baca juga: [Game Telegram PinEye Catat 500 Ribu Pengguna Aktif dalam Sepekan](https://www.coindesk.id/berita/sponsor/game-telegram-pin-eye-catat-500-ribu-pengguna-aktif-dalam-sepekan)**","link":"https://www.coindesk.id/berita/ini-alasan-game-tap-to-earn-menandai-perubahan-besar","img_url":"https://hub.coindesk.id/uploads/276_9_Juni_Ini_Alasan_Game_Tap_to_Earn_Menandai_Perubahan_Besar_c6ab485909.jpg","pub_date":"2024-07-10T02:56:01.000","coin":["NOT","ETH"]},{"source":"CryptoGlobe","title":"Bitcoin Price Rises Even as German Government Offloads Nearly $1 Billion in BTC","description":"The German government has recently moved nearly $1 billion worth of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) from its cryptocurrency wallet in a single day, sending shockwaves in the space as analysts feared a massive sell-off.
