Menurut hasil analisis dari <a href=\"https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/6671434baef6a3112f71b634-3-Reasons-Behind-the-Recent-Cryptocurrency-Market-Declines?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=sns&amp;utm_campaign=quicktake&amp;utm_content=it-tech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CryptoQuant</a>, terdapat setidaknya tiga faktor yang mengakibatkan penurunan harga mata uang kripto ini, termasuk kapitulasi <em>miner</em>, kurangnya penerbitan stablecoin baru, hingga arus keluar signifikan dari ETF Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pendapatan <em>miner </em>telah turun sebesar 55%, memaksa mereka untuk menjual lebih banyak Bitcoin untuk menutupi biaya operasional. Para <em>miner</em> pun mulai memindahkan Bitcoin dari <em>wallet</em> mereka ke <em>exchange</em>, yang dapat menurunkan harga dan seringkali menunjukkan mereka sedang menjualnya.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Selain itu, pasar stablecoin tidak melihat penerbitan baru, yang berarti lebih sedikit uang baru yang masuk ke pasar kripto. Hal ini dapat mengurangi likuiditas dan meningkatkan volatilitas harga.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tekanan jual lebih lanjut pada Bitcoin juga disebabkan oleh penarikan dana besar-besaran dari produk ETF Bitcoin spot, seperti yang dialami Fidelity dan Grayscale. Data <a href=\"http://farside.co.uk/?p=997\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Farside Investors</a> menunjukkan adanya arus keluar dana selama empat hari berturut-turut sejak 14 Juni.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdRs28x5R85AWBVrw-XyAd8hTFISChK7tnzzz9K9pC7FANlkWa1m5LJkLXHeASKx8MXXB59ocDFo20HSJ01nL7I5z09ouuuuZzzB4l8mJkeXgHBIJ7D-DyfobTaybn_H0mRdMYbiyukahd0_NSy688__Obj?key=9fC1Sdsxw15KEH41G2cIRg\" alt=\"bitcoin etf flow\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Tabel arus dana keluar dari ETF Bitcoin.

Menurut hasil analisis dari <a href=\"https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/6671434baef6a3112f71b634-3-Reasons-Behind-the-Recent-Cryptocurrency-Market-Declines?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=sns&amp;utm_campaign=quicktake&amp;utm_content=it-tech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CryptoQuant</a>, terdapat setidaknya tiga faktor yang mengakibatkan penurunan harga mata uang kripto ini, termasuk kapitulasi <em>miner</em>, kurangnya penerbitan stablecoin baru, hingga arus keluar signifikan dari ETF Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pendapatan <em>miner </em>telah turun sebesar 55%, memaksa mereka untuk menjual lebih banyak Bitcoin untuk menutupi biaya operasional. Para <em>miner</em> pun mulai memindahkan Bitcoin dari <em>wallet</em> mereka ke <em>exchange</em>, yang dapat menurunkan harga dan seringkali menunjukkan mereka sedang menjualnya.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Selain itu, pasar stablecoin tidak melihat penerbitan baru, yang berarti lebih sedikit uang baru yang masuk ke pasar kripto. Hal ini dapat mengurangi likuiditas dan meningkatkan volatilitas harga.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tekanan jual lebih lanjut pada Bitcoin juga disebabkan oleh penarikan dana besar-besaran dari produk ETF Bitcoin spot, seperti yang dialami Fidelity dan Grayscale. Data <a href=\"http://farside.co.uk/?p=997\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Farside Investors</a> menunjukkan adanya arus keluar dana selama empat hari berturut-turut sejak 14 Juni.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdRs28x5R85AWBVrw-XyAd8hTFISChK7tnzzz9K9pC7FANlkWa1m5LJkLXHeASKx8MXXB59ocDFo20HSJ01nL7I5z09ouuuuZzzB4l8mJkeXgHBIJ7D-DyfobTaybn_H0mRdMYbiyukahd0_NSy688__Obj?key=9fC1Sdsxw15KEH41G2cIRg\" alt=\"bitcoin etf flow\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Tabel arus dana keluar dari ETF Bitcoin.
