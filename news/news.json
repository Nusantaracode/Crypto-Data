Pencapaian ini membawa kita lebih dekat untuk mengintegrasikan mata uang digital ke dalam sistem keuangan arus utama.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stablecoin seperti USDC dan EURC dirancang untuk mempertahankan nilai stabil dengan mematok mata uang fiat seperti dolar AS dan euro. Stabilitas ini membantu investor menghindari volatilitas yang umum terjadi pada mata uang kripto lain seperti Bitcoin.

Lisensi ini memungkinkan Circle untuk menerbitkan USDC dan Euro Coin (EURC) di kawasan Uni Eropa. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeremy Allaire, salah satu pendiri dan CEO Circle, menekankan pentingnya pencapaian ini. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ia mengatakan, “Mencapai kepatuhan MiCA adalah langkah penting bagi Circle seiring kami terus membangun infrastruktur mata uang digital yang kuat dan teregulasi. Pencapaian ini membawa kita lebih dekat untuk mengintegrasikan mata uang digital ke dalam sistem keuangan arus utama.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stablecoin seperti USDC dan EURC dirancang untuk mempertahankan nilai stabil dengan mematok mata uang fiat seperti dolar AS dan euro. Stabilitas ini membantu investor menghindari volatilitas yang umum terjadi pada mata uang kripto lain seperti Bitcoin. Hal ini juga memungkinkan transisi yang mulus antara investasi kripto tanpa memerlukan rekening bank tradisional.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Persetujuan peraturan di bawah MiCA mengurangi kekhawatiran di kalangan investor tentang perlunya menebus stablecoin mereka atau mentransfer dana ke aset digital lainnya agar tetap patuh, sehingga meningkatkan kepercayaan investor terhadap pasar stablecoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baca juga: <a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/ceo-circle-ramal-stablecoin-akan-sumbang-10-keuangan-global-di-masa-depan\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"berita\" data-id=\"91473\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>CEO Circle Ramal Stablecoin akan Sumbang 10% Keuangan Global di Masa Depan</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"memahami-mica\">Memahami MiCA</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>MiCA mewakili kerangka peraturan komprehensif pertama di UE untuk aset digital, yang dirancang untuk melindungi investor dan mencegah manipulasi pasar.
