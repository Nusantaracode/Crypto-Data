Sebaliknya, selama fase euforia <em>bull market,</em> kontribusi investor jangka panjang terhadap pasokan yang berada dalam kerugian cenderung menuju nol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adapun Glassnode memperkirakan bahwa jika Bitcoin tetap di atas US$69.000 selama beberapa bulan ke depan, semua pemegang Bitcoin jangka panjang akan terus memperoleh keuntungan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baca juga: <a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/etf-bitcoin-spot-as-catatkan-kinerja-terbaik-sejak-maret\" data-type=\"berita\" data-id=\"91061\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>ETF Bitcoin Spot AS Catatkan Kinerja Terbaik Sejak Maret</strong></a></p>\n\n\n<iframe src='https://icn-dev.github.io/coinvestasi-button-shortcode/banner.html?banner_copy=Diskon%2015%25%20Tiket%20Coinfest%20Asia&button_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcoinvestasi.com%2FCA24coinvestasi&button_label=Beli%20Sekarang' style='width: 100%; height: 200px; border: none;'></iframe>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kerugian-investor-jangka-pendek\">Kerugian Investor Jangka Pendek</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Di sisi lain, investor Bitcoin jangka pendek (dengan kepemilikan BTC kurang dari 155 hari) saat ini menanggung sebagian besar kerugian yang belum direalisasikan. Ini terutama terjadi pada mereka yang membeli Bitcoin pada Maret sebelum mencapai level tertinggi sepanjang masa (ATH) di US$73.750 pada 14 Maret lalu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laporan Glassnode menunjukkan kelompok investor Bitcoin jangka pendek menanggung sebagian besar kerugian pasar, kondisi yang biasanya terjadi selama koreksi <em>bull market</em> dari ATH baru. Saat harga Bitcoin menyentuh posisi terendah pada pergerakan harga baru-baru ini di US$58.000, sebanyak 56% atau sekitar 1,9 juta BTC dari pasokan investor jangka pendek beralih ke posisi rugi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Namun, sejumlah besar pasokan secara teknis berada di bawah harga beli, besarnya kerugian yang belum direalisasikan tetap sejalan dengan koreksi <em>bull market </em>pada umumnya dan akan mulai mereda seiring dengan stabilnya pasar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Baik pemegang Bitcoin jangka panjang maupun jangka pendek telah mengalami pengaturan ulang dalam rasio risiko sisi-jual, yang menunjukkan bahwa keseimbangan baru telah ditemukan.
