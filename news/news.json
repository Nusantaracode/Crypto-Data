Koin meme ini, yang mengusung tema Play-to-Earn dengan maskot bergaya 8-bit dan seekor anak anjing Shiba Inu bernama Dogecoin, memiliki target untuk mendominasi pasar tahun ini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://coinvestasi.care/b_playdoge-id_88907\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://coinvestasi.care/b_playdoge-id_88907\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PlayDoge </a>memperkenalkan teknologi ekonomi digital dalam game yang terinspirasi dari mainan digital populer Tamagotchi dari tahun 90-an. Token aslinya, $PLAY, menjadi fondasi ekosistem ini, dengan berbagai macam utilitas dalam game dan pasar yang lebih luas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hal lain yang membedakan $PLAY dari koin meme lainnya adalah kemampuannya untuk berpindah antara BNB dan Ethereum, berkat sifat multichain-nya. Ini menjadikan PlayDoge jauh berbeda dari koin meme lainnya. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gim ini akan tersedia untuk diunduh secara instan di Apple App Store dan Google Play Store setelah dirilis. Karena itu, pemain tidak perlu membeli perangkat portabel untuk memainkannya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harga satu $PLAY saat ini adalah US$0,00517. Harga ini akan naik menjadi US$0,00518 di tahap presale berikutnya yang dimulai dalam waktu dua hari lagi. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dengan meningkatnya minat, para investor didorong untuk segera mengamankan token mereka dan menjadi bagian dari keuntungan koin meme hits berikutnya. Token $PLAY selain bisa diperjual belikan juga dapat di-<em>staking dengan </em>persentase imbal hasil tahunan yang fantastis sebesar 93%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PlayDoge diprediksi akan mengalami lonjakan harga signifikan. Seorang YouTuber terkenal bernama ClayBro, dengan 130.000 pelanggan, memprediksi harga $PLAY akan mencapai US$0,01 tahun ini, hampir dua kali lipat dari nilai presale saat ini. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lebih jauh lagi, harga diprediksi akan mencapai US$0,03 pada tahun 2025, dengan beberapa prediksi menyebutkan ekspansi seratus kali lipat mungkin terjadi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baca juga: <a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/presale-token-playdoge-raup-dana-us4-juta\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"berita\" data-id=\"91307\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Presale Token PlayDoge Raup Dana US$4 Juta</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rencana-playdoge-selanjutnya\">Rencana PlayDoge Selanjutnya</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>PlayDoge saat ini berada dalam fase awal dari peta jalannya. Pada tahap pertama, platform ini telah memulai presale dan melakukan audit kontrak pintar. Selanjutnya, pada tahap kedua, selain menyelesaikan presale, tim PlayDoge akan mendaftarkan token $PLAY ke bursa terdesentralisasi (DEX).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tahap ketiga akan melihat token <a href=\"https://coinvestasi.care/b_playdoge-id_88907\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://coinvestasi.care/b_playdoge-id_88907\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$PLAY</a> tersedia di bursa terpusat (CEX), yang diharapkan dapat meningkatkan aksesibilitas dan mendorong pertumbuhan harga. Pada tahap ini, versi beta mini-<em>game </em>juga akan dirilis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peluncuran penuh permainan dijadwalkan pada tahap keempat.

Koin meme ini, yang mengusung tema Play-to-Earn dengan maskot bergaya 8-bit dan seekor anak anjing Shiba Inu bernama Dogecoin, memiliki target untuk mendominasi pasar tahun ini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://coinvestasi.care/b_playdoge-id_88907\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://coinvestasi.care/b_playdoge-id_88907\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PlayDoge </a>memperkenalkan teknologi ekonomi digital dalam game yang terinspirasi dari mainan digital populer Tamagotchi dari tahun 90-an. Token aslinya, $PLAY, menjadi fondasi ekosistem ini, dengan berbagai macam utilitas dalam game dan pasar yang lebih luas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hal lain yang membedakan $PLAY dari koin meme lainnya adalah kemampuannya untuk berpindah antara BNB dan Ethereum, berkat sifat multichain-nya. Ini menjadikan PlayDoge jauh berbeda dari koin meme lainnya. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gim ini akan tersedia untuk diunduh secara instan di Apple App Store dan Google Play Store setelah dirilis. Karena itu, pemain tidak perlu membeli perangkat portabel untuk memainkannya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harga satu $PLAY saat ini adalah US$0,00517. Harga ini akan naik menjadi US$0,00518 di tahap presale berikutnya yang dimulai dalam waktu dua hari lagi. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dengan meningkatnya minat, para investor didorong untuk segera mengamankan token mereka dan menjadi bagian dari keuntungan koin meme hits berikutnya. Token $PLAY selain bisa diperjual belikan juga dapat di-<em>staking dengan </em>persentase imbal hasil tahunan yang fantastis sebesar 93%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PlayDoge diprediksi akan mengalami lonjakan harga signifikan. Seorang YouTuber terkenal bernama ClayBro, dengan 130.000 pelanggan, memprediksi harga $PLAY akan mencapai US$0,01 tahun ini, hampir dua kali lipat dari nilai presale saat ini. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lebih jauh lagi, harga diprediksi akan mencapai US$0,03 pada tahun 2025, dengan beberapa prediksi menyebutkan ekspansi seratus kali lipat mungkin terjadi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baca juga: <a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/presale-token-playdoge-raup-dana-us4-juta\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"berita\" data-id=\"91307\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Presale Token PlayDoge Raup Dana US$4 Juta</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rencana-playdoge-selanjutnya\">Rencana PlayDoge Selanjutnya</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>PlayDoge saat ini berada dalam fase awal dari peta jalannya.
