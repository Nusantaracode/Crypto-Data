Beberapa analis kripto berpendapat bahwa lonjakan harga mungkin terjadi setelah Bitcoin mengalami halving keempat pada 20 April 2024, yang juga bertepatan dengan <em>Doge Day</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Namun, ada juga yang menyatakan bahwa harga DOGE mungkin akan tetap stabil. Buktinya, setelah Bitcoin halving, harga DOGE adalah US$0,15 (10/5/24). Untuk mencapai US$1, harga DOGE perlu mengalami kenaikan 6,7 kali lipat dengan valuasi US$146 miliar, di bawah Ethereum. Hal ini hampir sulit terjadi dalam waktu dekat ini, meskipun hingga akhir tahun 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"459\" src=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-18-1024x459.png\" alt=\"doge memecoin\" class=\"wp-image-90446\" srcset=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-18-1024x459.png 1024w, https://wp.coinvestasi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-18-300x135.png 300w, https://wp.coinvestasi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-18-768x344.png 768w, https://wp.coinvestasi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-18-1536x689.png 1536w, https://wp.coinvestasi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-18-1568x703.png 1568w, https://wp.coinvestasi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-18-150x67.png 150w, https://wp.coinvestasi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-18.png 1788w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Gambar: Grafik harga DOGE.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sebagai alternatif memecoin selain DOGE dan juga bertema &#8220;anjing&#8221;, ada beberapa memecoin dengan valuasi yang lebih rendah seperti: Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogwifhat (WIF), dan Floki Inu (FLOKI), Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20), dan Dogeverse<a href=\"https://coinvestasi.care/b_dogeverse-id_74095\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> ($DOGEVERSE)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baca juga: <a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/harga-dogecoin-bangkit-lagi-naik-50-persen-dalam-seminggu\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"berita\" data-id=\"89082\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Harga Dogecoin Bangkit Lagi, Naik 50% dalam Seminggu!</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"potensi-memecoin-bertema-kucing\">Potensi Memecoin Bertema Kucing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sebagian besar memecoin bertema &#8220;kucing&#8221; tidak memiliki dasar yang kuat, tetapi banyak orang yang tetap membelinya karena <em>fear of missing out</em> (FOMO) alias takut tertinggal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hal ini mungkin karena memecoin bertema &#8220;anjing&#8221; sudah lebih dulu terkenal, sehingga ada anggapan bahwa memecoin kucing akan mengikuti jejak yang sama. Menurut data dari Coingecko, kapitalisasi pasar memecoin bertema kucing berkisar US$1,6 miliar (per 8 Mei 2024), jauh di bawah memecoin bertema anjing yang mencapai US$42,5 miliar. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Namun, beberapa investor spekulatif melihat potensi kenaikan yang signifikan pada memecoin bertema kucing.

Namun, mereka kadang-kadang terlihat menggunakan malware lamanya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Kami baru-baru ini menemukan bahwa aktor terkenal ini sedang menguji alatnya yang lama dan familiar, ThreatNeedle.

Tujuan utama alat pengikat adalah merakit penginstal malware, muatan aktual, dan konfigurasi,&#8221; tulis Kaspersky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secara total, Grup Lazarus diduga telah mencuri lebih dari US$3 miliar aset kripto dalam enam tahun menjelang tahun 2023. Lazarus dikreditkan dengan mencuri lebih dari 17% — sedikit di atas US$309 juta — dari total dana yang dicuri pada tahun 2023.
