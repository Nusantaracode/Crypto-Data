Kraken menerima peringatan program<em> bug bounty </em>dari seorang yang diduga peneliti keamanan.&nbsp;Peringatan tersebut menyorot<em>i bug</em> di sistem Kraken yang memungkinkan pengguna meningkatkan saldo akun mereka. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ketika pertukaran kripto memperbaiki <em>bug</em> tersebut, mereka menemukan tiga akun yang memanfaatkan kelemahan tersebut dan mencuri US$3 juta atau setara Rp49 miliar dari akun Kraken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kraken awalnya tidak mengungkap siapa peneliti keamanan yang mencuri uang tersebut, tetapi  pada 19 Juni <a href=\"https://x.com/CertiK/status/1803450205389402215\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://x.com/CertiK/status/1803450205389402215\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Certik</a> secara mandiri memberikan pengakuan bahwa mereka adalah dalang dibalik penemuan masalah dan eksploitasi tersebut. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certik yang menemukan <em>bug</em> berhak mendapatkan hadiah yang ditawarkan Kraken. Namun, tampaknya tidak ditemukan kesepakatan segera dan justru terjadi perdebatan antara keduanya, karena CertiK tidak langsung mengembalikan dana yang mereka ambil. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Sebaliknya, mereka meminta panggilan dengan tim pengembangan bisnis mereka (yaitu perwakilan penjualan mereka) dan belum setuju untuk mengembalikan dana apa pun sampai kami memberikan perkiraan jumlah $ yang mungkin disebabkan oleh bug ini jika mereka tidak mengungkapkannya. Ini bukan peretasan <em>white hat</em>, ini pemerasan,” kata Nicholas Percoco, kepala petugas keamanan Kraken. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kraken diketahui meminta CertiK mengembalikan 155.818 MATIC, 907.400 USDT, 475,5 ETH dan 1.089.8 XMR. Namun, CertiK hanya mengembalikan 734 ETH, 29.001 USDT, 1.021 MATIC.
