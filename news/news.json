Pada tahap-tahap berikutnya, POL juga akan mulai mengamankan blockchain lain dalam jaringan teragregasi yang lebih luas milik Polygon, termasuk AggLayer.\n\nAdapun token POL juga akan berfungsi sebagai token universal untuk semua jaringan berbasis Polygon, termasuk jaringan utama Polygon, jaringan zkEVM Polygon, dan berbagai supernet, yang merupakan blockchain khusus aplikasi yang beroperasi di atas jaringan utama Polygon.\n\nMenurut tim Polygon, pemegang MATIC pada _chain_ PoS Polygon tidak perlu melakukan apapun untuk peningkatan ini dan token mereka akan otomatis beralih menjadi POL. Namun, bagi mereka yang menggunakan MATIC pada rollup zkEVM Polygon, di _exchange_ terpusat, atau di blockchain Ethereum, maka mereka akan perlu menjalani beberapa langkah tertentu yang dijelaskan oleh Polygon dalam postingan blog mereka.\n\nSebagai bagian dari migrasi jaringan, Polygon telah menguji peningkatan token ini pada 17 Juli di _testnet_ mereka untuk mengidentifikasi atau memperbaiki masalah apapun sebelum POL resmi diluncurkan di _mainnet_.\n\n## Polygon 2.0\n\nMigrasi ini merupakan bagian dari rencana pembaruan Polygon yang dirancang pada 2023 lalu dalam _roadmap_ Polygon 2.0. Perubahan ini awalnya diusulkan pada Juli 2023 kepada komunitasnya, dan bertujuan menjadikan POL sebagai token _native_ untuk semua jaringan Polygon.\n\nPada awal Januari, Polygon Labs menyatakan bahwa Polygon 2.0 bertujuan untuk menciptakan pengalaman pengguna di berbagai jaringan blockchain seakan-akan menggunakan _single-chain_, terutama dengan pengenalan AggLayer. AggLayer akan mengumpulkan _zero-knowledge proofs_ (ZK-proofs) dari berbagai blockchain dan memungkinkan integrasi antara blockchain layer 1 dan layer 2 ke dalam jaringan terpadu.\n\nDengan AggLayer, pengguna dapat berinteraksi dengan berbagai blockchain tanpa perlu mengetahui bahwa mereka sedang mengakses _chain_ lain. Polygon menggambarkan pengalaman ini seperti menggunakan internet, di mana pengguna dapat memegang token di satu chain dan melakukan transaksi di blockchain lain dengan mudah.\n\n**Baca juga: [Polygon Kenalkan AggLayer, Bisa Satukan Berbagai Blockchain dalam Satu Jaringan](https://www.coindesk.id/berita/polygon-kenalkan-agg-layer-bisa-satukan-berbagai-blockchain-dalam-satu-jaringan)**","content":"Polygon Labs telah mengumumkan bahwa mereka akan melakukan peningkatan teknis yang akan menggantikan token MATIC dengan token baru, POL, mulai 4 September 2024.\n\nPada sebuah postingan blog (17/7/2024), Polygon Labs menyatakan bahwa perubahan ini akan terdiri dari peningkatan teknis yang memungkinkan POL menjadi token _gas fee_ dan _staking_ untuk _chain_ utama _proof-of-stake_ (PoS) Polygon. Pada tahap-tahap berikutnya, POL juga akan mulai mengamankan blockchain lain dalam jaringan teragregasi yang lebih luas milik Polygon, termasuk AggLayer.\n\nAdapun token POL juga akan berfungsi sebagai token universal untuk semua jaringan berbasis Polygon, termasuk jaringan utama Polygon, jaringan zkEVM Polygon, dan berbagai supernet, yang merupakan blockchain khusus aplikasi yang beroperasi di atas jaringan utama Polygon.\n\nMenurut tim Polygon, pemegang MATIC pada _chain_ PoS Polygon tidak perlu melakukan apapun untuk peningkatan ini dan token mereka akan otomatis beralih menjadi POL. Namun, bagi mereka yang menggunakan MATIC pada rollup zkEVM Polygon, di _exchange_ terpusat, atau di blockchain Ethereum, maka mereka akan perlu menjalani beberapa langkah tertentu yang dijelaskan oleh Polygon dalam postingan blog mereka.\n\nSebagai bagian dari migrasi jaringan, Polygon telah menguji peningkatan token ini pada 17 Juli di _testnet_ mereka untuk mengidentifikasi atau memperbaiki masalah apapun sebelum POL resmi diluncurkan di _mainnet_.\n\n## Polygon 2.0\n\nMigrasi ini merupakan bagian dari rencana pembaruan Polygon yang dirancang pada 2023 lalu dalam _roadmap_ Polygon 2.0.
