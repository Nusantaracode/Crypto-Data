Ini dapat berarti akan ada pengembalian yang lambat ke Bitcoin jika pasar menguat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Ketika kita mulai reli lagi, mereka mungkin akan dipaksa kembali ke pasar.

Menurut hasil analisis dari <a href=\"https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/6671434baef6a3112f71b634-3-Reasons-Behind-the-Recent-Cryptocurrency-Market-Declines?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=sns&amp;utm_campaign=quicktake&amp;utm_content=it-tech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CryptoQuant</a>, terdapat setidaknya tiga faktor yang mengakibatkan penurunan harga mata uang kripto ini, termasuk kapitulasi <em>miner</em>, kurangnya penerbitan stablecoin baru, hingga arus keluar signifikan dari ETF Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pendapatan <em>miner </em>telah turun sebesar 55%, memaksa mereka untuk menjual lebih banyak Bitcoin untuk menutupi biaya operasional.

Program <em>staking </em>dan likuiditas masing-masing akan menyumbang sekitar 20% dari pasokan token. Sisanya akan didistribusikan untuk pemasaran (15%), hadiah (15%), dan <em>listing </em>(10%).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Untuk mendapatkan hadiah, peserta harus menautkan akun X mereka untuk memverifikasi konten yang dibagikan. Setelah diverifikasi, peserta bisa mengklaim poin hadiah XP dan menukarkannya dengan $DAWGZ. Program ini menciptakan lingkaran kebajikan yang pada akhirnya membantu menumbuhkan komunitas $DAWGZ dan meningkatkan nilai token.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"manfaatkan-teknologi-base-chain-untuk-biaya-transaksi-rendah\">Manfaatkan Teknologi Base Chain untuk Biaya Transaksi Rendah</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Base Chain, jaringan yang dibangun oleh Coinbase di layer 2 Ethereum, telah menjadi salah satu alternatif proyek meme coin selain Solana. Jaringan ini menawarkan biaya transaksi yang lebih murah dan lebih cepat, sembari tetap menjaga keamanan blockchain Ethereum yang mendasarinya. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hal ini juga dimanfaatkan oleh Base Dawgz, sehingga pengguna dapat memperdagangkan token DAWGZ dengan biaya yang relatif rendah. Namun, Base Dawgz tidak hanya terbatas pada satu platform, karena $DAWGZ juga tersedia di Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, dan Avalanche. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Menurut <em>roadmap</em>-nya, Base Dawgz akan melakukan <em>listing </em>di DEX, CoinMarketCap, dan CoinGecko, serta mengintegrasikan dengan Birdeye untuk analisis pasar dan rekayasa pasca tahapan presale berakhir.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ReadWrite memprediksi $DAWGZ bisa memberikan pengembalian investasi (ROI) 10x saat peluncuran. Sementara itu, Tech Report melihat potensi 100x. 99Bitcoins juga memilih Base Dawgz sebagai salah satu dari sedikit koin yang bisa naik 10x di tahun ini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baca juga: <strong><a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/meme-koin-base-dawgz-resmi-buka-presale-token\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"berita\" data-id=\"91186\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Meme Koin Base Dawgz Resmi Buka Presale Token</a></strong></p>","link":"https://coinvestasi.com/berita/memecoin-base-dawgz-raup-dana-us1-juta-dari-presale-token","img_url":"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/10_06_2024_dawgz.jpg","pub_date":"2024-06-20T09:00:06.000","coin":["SOL","AVAX","W"]},{"source":"U.Today","title":"Bitcoin (BTC) $70,000 Imminent?

Peristiwa ini mengurangi <em>reward </em>tiap <em>block </em>yang diterima oleh para <em>miner </em>menjadi setengah, dari 6,25 BTC menjadi 3,125 BTC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laporan baru-baru ini menunjukkan bahwa jumlah Bitcoin (BTC) yang ditambang oleh penambang di Amerika Serikat pada Mei berkurang hingga 40% sebagai dampak dari Bitcoin halving.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Misalnya, Riot Platforms melaporkan bahwa produksi Bitcoin perusahaan mengalami penurunan sebesar 43% dari bulan ke bulan, dari 375 BTC pada April menjadi 215 BTC pada Mei. Adapun <a href=\"https://investors.cleanspark.com/news/news-details/2024/CleanSpark-Releases-May-2024-Bitcoin-Mining-Update/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CleanSpark</a> melaporkan penurunan produksi Bitcoin hingga 42%, dari 721 BTC menjadi 417 BTC pada periode yang sama.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baca juga: <strong><a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/produksi-mining-bitcoin-berkurang-40-pasca-halving\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"berita\" data-id=\"91098\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Produksi Mining Bitcoin Berkurang 40% Pasca Halving</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pengaruh-etf-bitcoin\">Pengaruh ETF Bitcoin</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Selama bulan Mei 2024, arus masuk bulanan ke dalam produk investasi aset digital mencapai US$2 miliar, yang terutama didorong oleh arus masuk ke dalam ETF Bitcoin.

Ini menandai arus keluar terbesar sejak 22 Maret 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hal ini kemungkinan disebabkan oleh faktor ekonomi makro dan sikap <em>hawkish </em>dari Komite Pasar Terbuka Federal (FOMC) dari The Fed yang mengindikasikan hanya akan memangkas suku bunga acuan AS satu kali pada 2024.

Peristiwa ini mengurangi <em>reward </em>tiap <em>block </em>yang diterima oleh para <em>miner </em>menjadi setengah, dari 6,25 BTC menjadi 3,125 BTC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laporan baru-baru ini menunjukkan bahwa jumlah Bitcoin (BTC) yang ditambang oleh penambang di Amerika Serikat pada Mei berkurang hingga 40% sebagai dampak dari Bitcoin halving.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Misalnya, Riot Platforms melaporkan bahwa produksi Bitcoin perusahaan mengalami penurunan sebesar 43% dari bulan ke bulan, dari 375 BTC pada April menjadi 215 BTC pada Mei. Adapun <a href=\"https://investors.cleanspark.com/news/news-details/2024/CleanSpark-Releases-May-2024-Bitcoin-Mining-Update/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CleanSpark</a> melaporkan penurunan produksi Bitcoin hingga 42%, dari 721 BTC menjadi 417 BTC pada periode yang sama.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baca juga: <strong><a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/produksi-mining-bitcoin-berkurang-40-pasca-halving\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"berita\" data-id=\"91098\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Produksi Mining Bitcoin Berkurang 40% Pasca Halving</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pengaruh-etf-bitcoin\">Pengaruh ETF Bitcoin</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Selama bulan Mei 2024, arus masuk bulanan ke dalam produk investasi aset digital mencapai US$2 miliar, yang terutama didorong oleh arus masuk ke dalam ETF Bitcoin. Menurut laporan <a href=\"https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-187-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-03a835f3e795\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CoinShares</a>, produk investasi kripto tersebut menyimpan hampir US$73 miliar Bitcoin secara global.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Namun, Coinshares juga mencatat adanya arus keluar sebesar US$621 juta dari ETF Bitcoin pada perdagangan pekan lalu. Ini menandai arus keluar terbesar sejak 22 Maret 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hal ini kemungkinan disebabkan oleh faktor ekonomi makro dan sikap <em>hawkish </em>dari Komite Pasar Terbuka Federal (FOMC) dari The Fed yang mengindikasikan hanya akan memangkas suku bunga acuan AS satu kali pada 2024. Sikap ini menyebabkan investor memilih untuk tidak berinvestasi pada aset dengan pasokan tetap seperti Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baca juga: <strong><a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/harga-bitcoin-dan-altcoin-rontok-ini-faktor-penyebabnya\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"berita\" data-id=\"91379\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Harga Bitcoin dan Altcoin Rontok, Ini Faktor Penyebabnya!</a></strong></p>","link":"https://coinvestasi.com/berita/metrik-cadangan-bitcoin-di-exchange-sentuh-titik-terendah-sejak-2022","img_url":"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20_06_2024_cadangan-bitcoin-di-exchange.jpg","pub_date":"2024-06-20T07:50:09.000","coin":["BTC"]},{"source":"U.Today","title":"Ethereum (ETH) To Start Gaining Some Strength, Is XRP Finally In Uptrend?

Selain itu, karena USDT ditransfer melalui blockchain, maka transfer dapat dilakukan kapan saja dan tidak hanya di hari kerja.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"peluang-penggunaan-defi\">Peluang Penggunaan DeFi</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>USDT memungkinkan akses ke berbagai platform dan layanan DeFi yang memberikan peluang untuk investasi, pinjaman, dan&nbsp;<em>staking&nbsp;</em>yang tidak tersedia dengan USD. Penggunaan USDT dalam DeFi juga dapat memberikan keuntungan tambahan melalui bunga dan imbal hasil yang lebih tinggi dibandingkan dengan rekening bank tradisional​.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kekurangan-usdt-dibanding-usd\">Kekurangan USDT dibanding USD</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"regulasi\">Regulasi</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>USD diatur oleh pemerintah dan lembaga keuangan, menawarkan lapisan keamanan dan regulasi yang mungkin tidak tersedia di dunia kripto. Sebaliknya, USDT, meskipun didukung oleh cadangan dolar, masih menghadapi tantangan regulasi dan potensi risiko yang lebih tinggi di pasar kripto​.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"potensi-volatilitas-kripto\">Potensi Volatilitas Kripto</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Meskipun USDT dipatok 1:1 dengan USD, pasar kripto secara keseluruhan sangat fluktuatif. Faktor-faktor seperti&nbsp;<em>hacking</em>, penipuan, dan kegagalan teknis dapat mempengaruhi nilai dan kepercayaan terhadap USDT​.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"keterbatasan-penggunaan\">Keterbatasan Penggunaan</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Meskipun USDT diterima di banyak platform kripto, penggunaannya di luar ekosistem kripto masih terbatas dibandingkan dengan USD, yang diterima secara luas dalam transaksi global sehari-hari​.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baca juga:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/venezuela-percepat-adopsi-usdt-untuk-hindari-sanksi-as\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Venezuela Percepat Adopsi USDT untuk Hindari Sanksi AS</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kesimpulan\">Kesimpulan</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Menggunakan kripto seperti USDT sebagai lindung nilai terhadap inflasi bisa menjadi alternatif yang menarik bagi masyarakat Indonesia, terutama ketika nilai rupiah melemah terhadap US Dolar. Dengan biaya pengiriman yang lebih rendah dan proses yang lebih cepat, USDT menawarkan solusi praktis untuk menjaga nilai aset di tengah inflasi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bagi yang tertarik menggunakan kripto sebagai lindung nilai, penting untuk melakukan riset mendalam dan memahami risiko yang terlibat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mulailah dengan jumlah kecil dan gunakan platform yang terpercaya untuk melakukan transaksi.

Selain itu, karena USDT ditransfer melalui blockchain, maka transfer dapat dilakukan kapan saja dan tidak hanya di hari kerja.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"peluang-penggunaan-defi\">Peluang Penggunaan DeFi</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>USDT memungkinkan akses ke berbagai platform dan layanan DeFi yang memberikan peluang untuk investasi, pinjaman, dan&nbsp;<em>staking&nbsp;</em>yang tidak tersedia dengan USD. Penggunaan USDT dalam DeFi juga dapat memberikan keuntungan tambahan melalui bunga dan imbal hasil yang lebih tinggi dibandingkan dengan rekening bank tradisional​.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kekurangan-usdt-dibanding-usd\">Kekurangan USDT dibanding USD</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"regulasi\">Regulasi</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>USD diatur oleh pemerintah dan lembaga keuangan, menawarkan lapisan keamanan dan regulasi yang mungkin tidak tersedia di dunia kripto. Sebaliknya, USDT, meskipun didukung oleh cadangan dolar, masih menghadapi tantangan regulasi dan potensi risiko yang lebih tinggi di pasar kripto​.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"potensi-volatilitas-kripto\">Potensi Volatilitas Kripto</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Meskipun USDT dipatok 1:1 dengan USD, pasar kripto secara keseluruhan sangat fluktuatif. Faktor-faktor seperti&nbsp;<em>hacking</em>, penipuan, dan kegagalan teknis dapat mempengaruhi nilai dan kepercayaan terhadap USDT​.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"keterbatasan-penggunaan\">Keterbatasan Penggunaan</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Meskipun USDT diterima di banyak platform kripto, penggunaannya di luar ekosistem kripto masih terbatas dibandingkan dengan USD, yang diterima secara luas dalam transaksi global sehari-hari​.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baca juga:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/venezuela-percepat-adopsi-usdt-untuk-hindari-sanksi-as\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Venezuela Percepat Adopsi USDT untuk Hindari Sanksi AS</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kesimpulan\">Kesimpulan</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Menggunakan kripto seperti USDT sebagai lindung nilai terhadap inflasi bisa menjadi alternatif yang menarik bagi masyarakat Indonesia, terutama ketika nilai rupiah melemah terhadap US Dolar. Dengan biaya pengiriman yang lebih rendah dan proses yang lebih cepat, USDT menawarkan solusi praktis untuk menjaga nilai aset di tengah inflasi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bagi yang tertarik menggunakan kripto sebagai lindung nilai, penting untuk melakukan riset mendalam dan memahami risiko yang terlibat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mulailah dengan jumlah kecil dan gunakan platform yang terpercaya untuk melakukan transaksi.
