Adapun upaya ini berlangsung sekitar dua minggu lalu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tawaran kampanye Biden disambut baik oleh banyak orang di sektor kripto. Namun, salah satu sumber mencatat bahwa beberapa pelaku industri tetap skeptis, melihat penjangkauan tersebut sebagai “terlalu sedikit dan terlalu terlambat.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keterlibatan baru Biden ini muncul tak lama setelah pendukung kripto menentang rencana pemerintahannya untuk memveto pencabutan aturan Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121), yang merupakan sebuah tindakan legislatif yang dikritik karena berpotensi menghalangi lembaga keuangan menawarkan layanan kustodian kripto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baca juga: <a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/ceo-cardano-kritik-keras-kebijakan-kripto-joe-biden\" data-type=\"berita\" data-id=\"90431\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>CEO Cardano Kritik Keras Kebijakan Kripto Joe Bi</strong></a><a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/singapore-bank-dbs-in-top-40-ethereum-holders-with-648-million-stash-nansen-finds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>den</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"peran-kripto-dalam-politik-as\">Peran Kripto dalam Politik AS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kripto telah menjadi salah satu topik paling hangat dalam kampanye pemilihan umum AS saat ini. Upaya tim kampanye Biden untuk melibatkan pelaku industri kripto mengikuti langkah mantan presiden dan calon presiden AS, Donald Trump, yang telah lebih dulu <a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/donald-trump-manfaatkan-narasi-kripto-untuk-raup-suara-di-pemilu-presiden-as-2024\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"berita\" data-id=\"90761\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">merangkul kripto</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump telah secara vokal menyatakan dirinya sebagai kandidat pro-kripto, terutama melalui <a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/donald-trump-mulai-terima-donasi-token-shib-dan-doge\" data-type=\"berita\" data-id=\"90672\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">donasi kampanye</a> yang mulai menerima berbagai mata uang kripto seperti Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), dan Shiba Inu (SHIB).</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe src='https://icn-dev.github.io/coinvestasi-button-shortcode/banner.html?banner_copy=Diskon%2015%25%20Tiket%20Coinfest%20Asia&button_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcoinvestasi.com%2F&button_label=Beli%20Sekarang' style='width: 100%; height: 200px; border: none;'></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>Sama halnya dengan Biden yang pernah merasa skeptis, Trump sebelumnya seringkali menunjukkan sikap keras terhadap mata uang kripto, terutama Bitcoin. Dalam <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/crypto-potentially-a-disaster-waiting-to-happen-trump.amp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">wawancara</a> dengan Fox Business tahun 2021, Trump menyatakan bahwa dolar harus menjadi mata uang utama dunia dan bahwa “kita tidak perlu memiliki semua Bitcoin di dunia ini.” Ia juga menekankan bahwa mata uang kripto harus diawasi dan diatur dengan ketat karena dianggap &#8216;berbahaya&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perubahan sikap kedua calon presiden AS tersebut tampaknya didorong oleh pengaruh tim kampanye mereka yang mengarahkan mereka ke pandangan yang lebih positif terhadap aset digital ini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Mereka memiliki orang-orang yang sangat cerdas dan cakap yang memberi nasihat tentang hal itu, dan industri telah melihat beberapa hasilnya dan akan melihat lebih banyak lagi dalam beberapa bulan mendatang,” kata seorang sumber, mengutip The Block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baca juga:<strong> <a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/donald-trump-kaji-potensi-kripto-untuk-atasi-masalah-utang-as\" data-type=\"berita\" data-id=\"90851\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Donald Trump Kaji Potensi Kripto untuk Atasi Masalah Utang AS</a></strong></p>","link":"https://coinvestasi.com/berita/joe-biden-minta-bantuan-industri-kripto-untuk-bangun-kebijakan-baru","img_url":"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/31_05_2024_joe-biden_new-crypto-policies.jpg","pub_date":"2024-05-31T06:25:17.000","coin":["BTC","SHIB","ETH"]},{"source":"CoinTelegraph","title":"How 1,500 new Bitcoin millionaires per day deal with getting rich","description":"Around 1,500 Bitcoin wallets top the million-dollar mark each day.
