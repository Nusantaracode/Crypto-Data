Pola tersebut sering kali menandakan penurunan harga yang lebih tajam. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thielen mencatat bahwa BTC saat ini sedang menguji level <em>support </em>kritis, dan jika <em>support</em> ini tidak bertahan, harga bisa jatuh ke sekitar US$50.000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Formasi grafik ini seharusnya menjadi dasar kita kecuali terbukti tidak valid. Formasi ini bisa dengan mudah melihat penurunan ke US$50.000,&#8221; jelas Thielen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analisis  serupa juga diutarakan oleh <em>Financial Expert </em>Ajaib Kripto, Panji Yudha, menyebut bahwa Bitcoin saat ini berada di fase akumulasi setelah BTC Halving pada April lalu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Bitcoin mencatat puncak tertingginya di $73.750 pada Maret dan telah menjalani halving keempat pada April lalu. Kini, kita mungkin berada dalam fase akumulasi pasca-halving, di mana penurunan harga dimanfaatkan oleh investor untuk membeli lebih banyak.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Untuk itu, Panji mengatakan strategi yang bisa digunakan saat ini adalah<a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/pemula/panduan/pemula/dollar-cost-averaging-crypto\" data-type=\"panduan\" data-id=\"70954\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> <em>dollar dost averaging</em> (DCA).</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Mengingat volatilitas Bitcoin, strategi <em>dollar cost averaging </em>(DCA) bisa menjadi pilihan tepat. Investor bisa mempertimbangkan akumulasi di kisaran US$55.000-US$60.000, dengan perkiraan reli harga sekitar enam bulan pasca-halving, yakni pada Oktober 2024, didorong oleh sentimen positif seperti potensi pemotongan suku bunga Federal Reserve pada FOMC September 2024.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baca juga: <a href=\"https://wp.coinvestasi.com/berita/analis-prediksi-dampak-ganti-rugi-bitcoin-mt-gox-tak-separah-perkiraan\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"berita\" data-id=\"91575\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Analis Prediksi Dampak Ganti Rugi Bitcoin Mt.
